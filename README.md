# links-resources-info-etc
finally making a git repo for my collection of useful links and information that i've accumulated


made this because i stumbled upon another interesting website that i want to save for later and can't access my server. i figure this is a good place to store my bookmarks, and other things. i'll add more stuff when i get home. then i'll write a script that will automatically pull things from it so my laptop and any other relevant devices can be synced.
